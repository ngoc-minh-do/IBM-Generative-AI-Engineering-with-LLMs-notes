# Explore Advanced Retrievers in Langchain: Part 1

## Learning objective
- Explain what LangChain retrievers are.
- Describe the vector store-based retriever
- Explain how the Vector Store-Based Retriever works.

## LangChain retriever
- A LangChain retriever is an interface that returns documents based on an unstructured query.
- It is more general than a vector store.
- It doesn't necessarily store documents as its purpose is to retrieve them or their chunks.
- A LangChain retriever accepts a string query as input and returns a list of documents or chunks as output.
	Although the process of retrieving data sounds simple, it can be subtly complex with several implementations possible.

## Vector Store-Based Retriever
Let's learn more about the simplest type of retriever the vector store-based retriever which retrieves documents from a vector database.
Recall that this vector database is brought into existence by loading source documents, splitting them into chunks, and embedding them.
The vector store-based retriever plugs into this existing vector store.
It accepts a query and retrieves the most similar data, in this case the most similar chunks.

The vector store-based retriever works by embedding the query and then comparing it with embedded chunks using similarity search or maximum marginal relevance, also known as MMR, to retrieve the most relevant chunks.
The vector store-based retriever is simple to understand because it queries an existing vector store and does not require an LLM to retrieve the most similar chunks.

## Vector Store-Based Retriever: Maximum marginal relevance (MMR) retrieval
In addition to using a similarity score, you can use maximum marginal relevance retrieval or MMR.
- MMR in vector stores is a technique used to balance the relevance and diversity of retrieved results.
- It selects documents that are both highly relevant to the query and minimally similar to previously selected documents.
- This approach helps to avoid redundancy and ensures a more comprehensive coverage of different aspects of the query.

In this particular example, the query email policy results in three retrieved documents.

## Recap
- Lanchain retriever is an interface that returns documents based on an unstructured query.
- Vector store-based retriever retrieves documents from a vector database using similarity search or MMR.
- Similarity search is when the retriever accepts a query and retrieves the most similar data.
- MMR is a technique used to balance the relevance and diversity of retrieved results.
