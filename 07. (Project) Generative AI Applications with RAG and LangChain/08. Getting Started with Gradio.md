# Getting Started with Gradio

## Learning objective
- Describe what Gradio is 
- Explain how to set up a Gradio interface for model interaction.

## Gradio
Gradio is an open-source python library for creating customizable web-based user interfaces.
It is designed for ease of use, especially for machine learning models and computational tools.

Lets take a step by step look at how it works.
- First you write the Python code to define the functions and logic for your application.
- Next, you use Gradio to create an interface for these functions.
	- Here you use Gradio's interface class to specify the inputs and outputs for your functions.
	- Then configure the interface to define how users will interact with your application.
- The next step is launching the Gradio server using the launch method.
	- This starts a local server on your machine creating a web interface for your application.
- As the final step, you have access to the web interface through a local or public URL provided by Gradio.
	- Users can interact with the interface providing inputs and receiving outputs in real time.

## Simple text input and output with Gradio
First, you need to install the Gradio package using PIP.
Once installed, you can `import gradio as gr`.
Now let's code a simple Gradio interface that has a text input field, and then displays the entered text as output.
The `gr.Interface` function is a core component of the Gradio library.
It creates interactive web interfaces for Python functions with customizable input and output components.
You then define the function to be executed once the user enters the query.
Here you can define any functionality according to the use case, in this case, you're just returning the enter text.
`gr.Textbox` is used to create a text box wherein you can also define a custom label for the text box.
Similarly, you create a textbox for the output.
Using launch, you can then run the interface.
```python
import gradio as gr

def process_text(text):
	return f"You entered: '{text}'"

demo = gr. Interface(
	fn = process_text,
	inputs = gr. Textbox (label = "Enter some text"), # Textbox input
	outputs = gr. Textbox (label = "Output") # Textbox output
)

demo.launch ()
```

Here is the Gradio interface you get from the code.
As you can see here, there are two text boxes, one for input and one for output.

## Multiple inputs with Gradio
Lets see how you can have multiple inputs in the Gradio interface.
Just like `gr.Textbook` is used to create a text field, in the same way gr.Number is used to create a numeric field.
You can pass gr.Number and gr.Textbook as a list of inputs.
Similarly, if you want to add more inputs you can add them here in the input list.
```python
def process_number_and_text(number, text):
	return f"The number is {number} and the text is '{text}'."

demo = gr.Interface(
	fn = process_number_and_text,
	inputs = [
		gr.Number(label = "Enter a number"), # Number input
		gr.Textbox(label = "Enter some text") # Textbox input
	],
	outputs = gr.Textbox(label = "Output") # Textbox output
)

demo.launch()
```

Now, let's see the output from the generated code.
You can observe that you now have two types of inputs, one for text and one for numeric values.

## Upload/Drop files with Gradio
You can also create an option to upload or drop files with Gradio.
Here is a code to count the number of files uploaded by a user.
`gr.File` allows users to upload files in a web interface.
It supports multiple file uploads, and provides paths to uploaded files for further processing in the backend function.
You then define the count files to calculate the number of files uploaded by the user.
```python
def count_files(files):
	return f"Number of files uploaded: {len(files)}"

demo = gr.Interface(
	fn = count_files,
	inputs = gr.File(
		file_count = "multiple",
		type = "filepath",
		label = "Upload or Drag Files Here"
	),
	outputs = gr.Textbox(label = "Number of Files Uploaded"),
)

demo.launch()
```

Once you launch the code, it generates a unique web interface link which can be used from anywhere until the session is running.
You now have the option to upload or drop the files through a web interface.

## Recap
- Gradio is an open-source Python library for creating customizable web-based user interfaces.
- To set it up
	- write the Python code
	- create the Gradio interface
	- launch the Gradio server using the launch method
	- access the web interface through a local or public URL provided by Gradio.
- You learned that to code a simple text input and output with a Gradio interface, you can use the Gradio interface function.
- Finally, you learned that to upload or drop files with Gradio in a web interface, you can use the gr.File.
