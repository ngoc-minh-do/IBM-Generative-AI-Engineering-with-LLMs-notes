## RNN (Recurrent neural network)
- use sequential or time series data
- Loop based design enables RNN to remember previous inputs and influence the current input and output
- Applications: 
	- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
	- Language translation
	- Speech recognition
	- Image captioning 
## Transformer
- Are learning models that can translate text and speech in near real time
- Employs feedback mechanisms to improve accuracy
- designed with self attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on the most important parts of the information its looking at, making its understanding and decision, making its more efficient
- The selective focus on different parts of the input sequence allows the model to concentrate on specific segments concurrently, enabling parallelization for efficient training
- Example : GPT
## GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
- Is a gen Al model consisting of 2 sub models, a generator and a discriminator
- The generator create fake samples and sends them to the discriminator. The discriminator check their authenticity by comparing them with real samples from a domain set
- It then assign a probability score to each sample indicating how likely the sample is to be authentic.
- This adversarial (đối nghịch) process continues like a friendly competition, with the generator striving to make things look real and the discriminator learning to distinguish between real and jake, both entities improving their respective outputs
- Useful for : 
	- Image generation
	- Video generation
## VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
- The encoder network first compresses input data into a simplified abstract space that capture essential characteristics
- The decoder network then use this condensed information to recreate the original data
- VAE focus on learning the underlying patterns within the input data, making it possible to create new data samples that share similar characteristics.
- VAE represent data using probability distributions in the latent (tiềm ấn) space
- They cam produce a range of possible outputs for a given input, reflecting the inherent uncertainty (sự không chắc chắn cố hữu) in real world data
- useful in application related to ant and creative design
## Diffusion model
- Is a probabilistic generative model
- is trained to generate image by learning how to remove noise or reconstruct examples from its training data that have been distorted (bóp meó) beyond recognition
- Depending on the prompt, a diffusion model can generate highly creative images based on the statistical properties of its training data
- you can use a diffusion model to generate high quality images from noisy or low quality inputs, like restoring and old distorted photograph 
## Relation to Reinforcement learning (RL)
- Generative AI models are closely tied to reinforcement learning
- Traditional reinforcement learning focuses on how agents like AI systems or robots interact with their environment to maximize rewards. 
- Generative AI models employ reinforcement learning techniques during training to fine tune and optimize their performance for specific tasks
