## PyTorch
- PyTorch is a software-based open source deep learning framework originally developed by Facebook AI research now Meta for building neural networks.
- It combines Torches machine learning library with a Python-based high level API.
- Its flexibility and ease of use, among other benefits, have made it the leading ML framework for academic and research communities.
- PyTorch supports a wide variety of neural network architectures and is built on the widely understood Python programming language.
- It offers extensive libraries, a preconfigured, and even pre-trained models.
- PyTorch allows data scientists to run and test portions of code in real time rather than wait for the entire code to be implemented, which can take a long time for large deep learning models.
- This makes PyTorch an excellent platform for rapid prototyping and greatly expedites the debugging process.
